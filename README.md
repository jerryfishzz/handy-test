# Handy Test

A multichoice self-test app. Write down your study notes then review them.

The app will only show 10 questions each time. So don't worry it will be a dull and boring one. The 10 questions are randomly taken from the database. So again, don't worry about it will be a dull and boring repeating work every time you go : )

## Installation

Just `npm install` and `npm start`, then enjoy it.

## Built With

- Redux for state management

- [Material UI]  The main UI library used in this project.

- [React Select] For dropdown menu

- [Draft.js] For rich text editor

- [Wordpress] Wordpress API to communicate with front-end and server-side

## Limitations

This project is still under construction. Not all the functionalities have been implemented.

- Only support multichoice questions with one correct answer.

## Future Progress

This app will be still temporarily based on the current working mode: multichoice questions with one correct answer. New feats will be focus on the following points:

- Mobile supportive. Then it can be called **handy**. It probably looks like my another complete project: [mobile flashcard].
