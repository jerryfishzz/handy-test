# Handy Test

A multi-choice self-test app. Write down your study notes then review them. Don't worry about you will forget.

## Installation

Just `npm install` and `npm start`, then enjoy it.

## Built With

- [Material UI]  The main UI library used in this project.

- [React Select] For dropdown menu

## Limitations

This project is still under construction. Not all the functionalities have been implemented.

- Only support multichoice questions with one correct answer.

## Future Progress

This app will be still temporarily based on the current working mode: multichoice questions with one correct answer. New feats will be focus on the following points:

- Partially or completely migrate from context API to redux

- Add layout for code since it focuses on programming currently.

- Mobile supportive. Then it can be called **handy**. It probably looks like my another complete project: [mobile flashcard].
